        <h5>Formula:</h5>
        <p><strong>Thought Leadership Score = ((Likes × 1) + (Comments × 2) + (Shares × 3) + (Followers × 0.5)) / Total Posts</strong></p>

        <h5>Example Calculation:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Likes:</strong> 500</li>
            <li><strong>Comments:</strong> 200</li>
            <li><strong>Shares:</strong> 100</li>
            <li><strong>Followers:</strong> 10,000</li>
            <li><strong>Total Posts:</strong> 50</li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> ((500 × 1 + 200 × 2 + 100 × 3 + 10,000 × 0.5) / 50) = <b>124</b></li>
        </ul>
