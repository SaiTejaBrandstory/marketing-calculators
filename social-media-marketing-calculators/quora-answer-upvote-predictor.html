        <h5>Formula:</h5>
        <p><strong>Predicted Upvotes = ((Views × 0.1) + (Rating × 1.5) + (Followers × 0.2)) / 10</strong></p>

        <h5>Example Calculation:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Views:</strong> 1000</li>
            <li><strong>Rating:</strong> 8</li>
            <li><strong>Followers:</strong> 2000</li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> ((1000 × 0.1 + 8 × 1.5 + 2000 × 0.2) / 10) = <b>51.20</b></li>
        </ul>
