        <h5>Formula:</h5>
        <p><strong>Engagement Growth Score = ((Likes × 1) + (Comments × 2) + (Shares × 3) + (Followers × 0.5)) / Total Posts</strong></p>

        <h5>Example Calculation:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Likes:</strong> 300</li>
            <li><strong>Comments:</strong> 150</li>
            <li><strong>Shares:</strong> 50</li>
            <li><strong>Followers:</strong> 8,000</li>
            <li><strong>Total Posts:</strong> 40</li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> ((300 × 1 + 150 × 2 + 50 × 3 + 8,000 × 0.5) / 40) = <b>118.75</b></li>
        </ul>
