        <h5>Formula:</h5>
        <p><strong>Overlap Risk (%) = (Overlap Audience / Total Audience) × 100</strong></p>
        <h6>Example Calculation:</h6>
        <p>Suppose Campaign 1 has 1000 audience members, Campaign 2 has 1200, and there is an overlap of 200.</p>
        <p>Overlap Risk = (200 / (1000 + 1200 - 200)) × 100 = 14.29%</p>
